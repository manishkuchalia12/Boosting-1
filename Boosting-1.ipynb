    "Q10. What is the effect of increasing the number of estimators in AdaBoost algorithm?\n",
    "Ans:-Increasing the number of estimators (weak learners) in the AdaBoost algorithm can have both positive and negative effects on the model's performance. Here are some key considerations:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Positive Effects:\r\n",
    "Improved Accuracy:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In general, adding more weak learners to the ensemble tends to improve the overall accuracy of the AdaBoost model. This is especially true in the early iterations.\r\n",
    "Reduced Bias:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Increasing the number of estimators allows the model to fit the training data more closely, reducing bias. The ensemble becomes more expressive and can capture complex relationships in the data.\r\n",
    "Negative Effects:\r\n",
    "Diminishing Returns:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "There is a point of diminishing returns where adding more weak learners may not significantly improve performance, and the model may start to overfit the training data.\r\n",
    "Increased Variance:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "While AdaBoost is less prone to overfitting compared to individual weak learners, increasing the number of estimators can still lead to increased variance. The model may become more sensitive to noise in the training data.\r\n",
    "Computational Cost:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Training more weak learners increases the computational cost and training time. The algorithm needs to go through more iterations, and each iteration involves updating weights and training a new weak learner.\r\n",
    "Potential Overfitting:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "If the number of estimators is too high, the model might start memorizing the training data, capturing noise and outliers. This can lead to overfitting, especially if the dataset is small or noisy.\r\n",
    "Early Stopping:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Practitioners often use early stopping techniques to monitor the performance on a validation set and stop training when the performance plateaus or starts to degrade. This helps prevent overfitting and unnecessary computational expense.\r\n",
    "Recommendations:\r\n",
    "Cross-Validation:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Perform cross-validation to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the training data. This helps in understanding the trade-off between bias and variance.\r\n",
    "Early Stopping:\r\n",
